# Unity URP Simplified Toon Lit Shader Example (for you to learn writing custom lit shader in URP)
A very simple toon lit shader example, to help people writing their first custom toon lit shader in URP.

This shader's default result(without edit material params) = the following picture:

Because this toon lit shader was created to help people learning shader writing the first time in URP, it is an extremely simplified version of the original one (I removed 80% of my original code, while just keeping only the most useful & easy to understand sections), to make sure everyone can understand the shader code easily.

Maybe I simplified it too much, it is now a "How to write your first custom lit shader in URP" example, instead of a good toon lit example (lots of toon lit tricks are not included in this shader, for simplicity reason).

Why creating this "simplified version" toon lit shader?
-------------------
Lots of my shader friends are looking for a toon lit example shader in URP (not Shader Graph), I want them to switch to URP with me, so I decided to provide a simple enough URP toon lit shader example. 

Some screenshots from the original(Full version) shader:

How to try this simplified example shader in my URP project?
-------------------
1. Clone all .shader & .hlsl files into your URP project.
2. Put these files inside the same folder.
3. Change your character's material's shader to "SimpleURPToonLitExample(With Outline)"
4. make sure atleast _BaseMap(albedo) is assigned
5. setup DONE, you can now test your character with light probe/directional light/point light/spot light
6. edit the material properties to see how the render result changes
7. Most important: open these shader files, spend some time reading it, you will understand how to write custom lit shader in URP very quickly
8. Most important: open "SimpleURPToonLitOutlineExample_LightingEquation.hlsl", edit it, experiment with your own toon lighting equation ideas, which is the key part of toon lit shader!

What is NOT included in this simplified example shader?
-------------------
For simplicity reason, I removed most of the features from the original shader (deleted 80% of the original shader package), else this shader will be way too complex for reading & learning. The removed features are:
- face sphere proxy normal & direction proxy normal (fixing face ugly normals, very important)
- smooth outline normal auto baking (fixing ugly outlines, very important)
- hair "angel ring" reflection
- character bounding sphere proxy normal
- rim light
- specular lighting
- HSV control shadow & outline color
- 2D mouth renderer
- stencil local hair shadow on face
- depth offset for eye rendering over hair
- most of the extra texture input options like AO, specular, normal map...
- LOTS of sliders to control lighting, final color & outline

When will the original toon lit shader(Full version) release?
-------------------
We don't have ETA now, we are still working on it, here are some videos about the original toon lit shader:

How to get a test character model?
-------------------
The easiest way to get a character model is downloading Unity-Chan in the assetstore.

Also, here are some websites that can download models(If the creator allows it)
- https://3d.nicovideo.jp/
- https://hub.vroid.com/

if you downloaded a .pmx file, use this to convert it to .fbx & prefab directly inside unity

MMD4Mecanim (Beta)
http://stereoarts.jp/

if you downloaded a .vrm file, use this to convert it to .fbx & prefab directly inside unity

Editor environment requirement
-----------------------
- URP 7.2.1 or above
- Unity 2019.3 or above
