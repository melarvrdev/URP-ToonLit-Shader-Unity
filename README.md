# UnityURPToonLitShaderExample
A very simple toon lit shader example, for you to learn writing custom shader in Unity URP.

How to try this shader in my project?
-------------------
1. Clone all files into your URP project.
2. Put these files inside the same folder.
3. Change your character's material's shader to "SimpleURPToonLitExample(With Outline)"
4. (optional) edit material properties
5. DONE

What is removed from in the example?
-------------------
For simplicity, we removed these features from this example shader, else this shader will be too complex for learning.
- face sphere proxy normal
- GI sphere proxy normal
- rim light
- specular lighting
- HSV control shadow & outline color
- 2D mouth renderer
- stencil local hair shadow on face
- depth offset for eye rendering over hair
- lots of little features to control final color..........
